# planning
scoping this out

* Hit the google API for all avaliable fonts. https://developers.google.com/fonts/docs/developer_api
  * will have to do this once per UA https://neverpanic.de/blog/2014/03/19/downloading-google-web-fonts-for-local-hosting/
* For each result:
  * find/create a new repo
  * init a new module if necessary under the `@font` scope
  * make a css file for each style, include each font source
  * make an index file
  * commit and release
